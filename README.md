svm.js

Support Vector Machines implementation in javascript using SMO algorithm.

A similiar implementation can be found in https://github.com/karpathy/svmjs.
However, the version of SMO used does not guarantee converge.

[TODO]

Need to create test and data set. Also, I haven't tested yet at all,
meaning that it's just a straight implementation of the algorithm from
the paper.
